            <p class="normal-text">"Our people, particularly the youth, gained us independence from an autocratic and undemocratic regime with their exceptional resolve and capability. That collective resolve should define Bangladesh of the future and place our nation as a responsive and responsible state in the comity of nations. We must ensure that we do not miss this chance to build a new Bangladesh due to our differences. If we lose this opportunity now, we will be defeated as a nation. To the martyrs, the injured and the living students, we pledge that we will not let this achievement go to waste."</p>
